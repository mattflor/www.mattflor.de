_This post is just a shoutout to the R world and to test whether everything works as expected.
That said, it basically is a shameless copy from the example website included with the excellent [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package that I am using to set up this blog.
Also, I love the pie chart below in Fig. \@ref(fig:pie)._

_The blog's theme is [Beautiful Hugo](https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo.git) which is a port of [Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com)'s [Beautiful Jekyll](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) theme._

_So, here goes..._
    
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots. See Figure \@ref(fig:pie) for example:

```{r pie, fig.cap='A fancy pie chart.', tidy=FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#2196F3', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```

# Math

$S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$
