My name Matt(hias) Flor.
I am interested in data science, visualization, reproducibility, and the like.
A few years ago, I stumbled upon (or should I say, I *was* stumbled upon?) the statistical programming language [R](https://cran.r-project.org/).
Coming from Python, it took a while but [I learned to stop worrying and love](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/) R.
And now this blog is mainly a place to keep track of the tricks I continue to learn.
For future reference for myself mostly.

My original background is in Theoretical Biology.
Mathematical modelling of evolutionary processes, to be a bit more specific.
I did my PhD on researching how [these little critters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolbachia) may affect speciation in their insect hosts.
